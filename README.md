# YOLOv8 Object Detection (Image & Webcam)

This project demonstrates how to use a **pre-trained YOLOv8 model** to perform **object detection** on a single image or using a **live webcam feed**.  
The detected objects are highlighted with **bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores**, and the final output image is saved as `results.jpg`.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Uses **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** pre-trained model
- Detects objects in an **image URL or local image**
- Supports **live webcam object detection**
- Saves output image with bounding boxes as `results.jpg`
- Simple and beginner-friendly Python code

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- OpenCV
